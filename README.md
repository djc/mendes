Mendes is a Rust web toolkit for impatient perfectionists (apologies to Django).
It aims to be:

* Modular: less framework, more library; pick and choose components
* Async: async/await from the start
* Low boilerplate: easy to get started, but with limited "magic"
* Type-safe: leverage the type system to make error handling low effort
* Secure: provide high-grade security by default
* Run on stable Rust (no promises on MSRV though)

Mendes is currently in an extremely early phase and probably not ready for anything
but experiments for those who are curious. Feedback is always welcome though!

## Minimal example

This should definitely become more minimal over time.

```rust
use async_trait::async_trait;
use http::{Request, Response, StatusCode};
use hyper::Body;
use mendes::{Application, Context};
use mendes_derive::{dispatch, handler};

#[handler(App)]
async fn hello(_: &App, _: Request<()>) -> Result<Response<Body>, Error> {
    Ok(Response::builder()
        .status(StatusCode::OK)
        .body("Hello, world".into())
        .unwrap())
}

struct App {}

#[async_trait]
impl Application for App {
    type RequestBody = ();
    type ResponseBody = Body;
    type Error = Error;

    #[dispatch]
    async fn handle(mut cx: Context<Self>) -> Response<Body> {
        path! {
            _ => hello,
        }
    }

    fn error(&self, _: Error) -> Response<Body> {
        Response::builder()
            .status(StatusCode::INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR)
            .body("ERROR".into())
            .unwrap()
    }
}

#[derive(Debug)]
enum Error {}
```

All feedback welcome. Feel free to file bugs, requests for documentation and
any other feedback to the [issue tracker][issues].
